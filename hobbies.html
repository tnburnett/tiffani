      Video Games such as Halo and Call of Duty have taught me teamwork, quick thinking,
       and communication skills. Other simulation games, such as Sims 4 have
       taught me to think creatively and imaginatively to create unique builds, characters,
       and storylines. As well the communities I have become a part of through these games have
       introduced me to people of all kinds and helped be to become a more open and understanding
       person, accepting of all who I may encounter.

    <p>
      Dirt track racing has also taught me teamwork and quick thinking skills.
      It has also taught me conflict resolution skills, not only with my own conflicts,
      but quite often the conflicts of others. It has also taught me that every decision
      you make has an impact somewhere along the line. And that you don't have to be win
      every time to succeed.
